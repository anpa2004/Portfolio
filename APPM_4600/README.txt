This is a folder containing all the work for my Numerical Methods course, APPM 4600. This course had weekly homeworks focused on some aspect of the course. The class required Python skills and GitHub knowledge. The homeworks contain usually a .py file, with all of the code necessary to create the graphs in the final homework submission. The final homework submission was a .pdf from a latex document.
