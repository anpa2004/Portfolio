This is my folder for APPM 23600- Differential Equations and Linear Algebra. The main projects were two projects to get exposure to solving real life problems for this type of math. 

- The first project was modeling the temperature in a building due to changes from people being inside, outside temperature fluctuations, computer banks heating things and AC systems with feedback control. 

- The second project was using Markov chains to predict someone's proability of getting sick due to factors like isolation, having already been sick and other factors. 

All projects were on teams of 3 people and written in MATLAB.
