This folder contains code for a junior level lab at CU - Aerospace Sciences Lab. The course consisted of three labs- a structural analysis lab, a thermodynamics heat transfer lab and an aerodynamics lab. For the labs, we were split into teams of 4 people. All code is in MATLAB. 

- For the thermodynamics lab (lab 2), I was responsible for a lot of the code development and modeling of the steady state solutions. This code contains code to calculate Fourier Coefficients to solve the heat equation for heat transfer through a 1 dimensional bar due to constant heat flux on one end and a fixed temperature second end. 

For the submission of this lab, we turned in the three documents: ASEN_3802_lab2_part_1, ASEN_3802_lab2_part_2, ASEN_3802_lab2_part_3. 

- For the aerodynamics lab (lab 3), I wrote all of the code for my team. We designed code to calculate Prandtl Lifting Line coefficients to model a Fourier Series over an airfoil for a Cessna aircraft. This allowed us to model the lift and drag for the whole aircraft. A lot of modeling and assumptions were made in order to calculate unknown or not constant properties. 

For the submission of this lab, we turned in the three documents: ASEN_3802_lab3_part_1, ASEN_3802_lab3_part_2, ASEN_3802_lab3_part_3.
