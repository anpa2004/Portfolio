Welcome to Andrew Patella's GitHub Portfolio. This is designed to showcase some of the projects that I am particularly proud of. Every folder that has a class code on it is the code developed in that class or lab that I used for analysis or for homework. Every class folder has a README explaining the course and the contents of that folder. 

Personal projects have the title 'personal' to indicate that. They are usually side projects or tools I have built to be useful in every class I take. 

The repository is mostly full of MATLAB because that is the preferred language of CU Boulder's Aerospace Program. Most of the code I have developed for side projects is in Python just because it is a personal preference. 

For any questions about any of the projects or for more explanation of anything, please email me at andrew.patella04@gmail.com. Thank you for visiting this repo!
