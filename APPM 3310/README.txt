This is my folder for APPM 3310 - Matrix Methods and Applications. The main content is my project. 

This project was about replicating and studying some matrix method in a research paper. My group studied a paper on modeling and calculating the eigenvalues of a dynamical system without having to create the whole state space since it is for a very complex system- the transmembrane voltage across two parts of a heart. The paper studied how the trends in the eigenvalues helped predict cardiac alternans. 

I did most of the code. One of the biggest challenges we had in replicating the paper was we didn't have any transmembrane voltage data to analyze. I decided to simulate my own data in order to have something to analyze. The paper included a graph of a single cardiac cycle of data. I used this, fitting a curve to it and randomizing with noise to create a set of data with n beats. This we used to determine the stability of the simulated heart. 

The original paper, our proposal and final report are all included in this folder. All code is in MATLAB.
